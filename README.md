# IoT & Robotics MCP/OpenCV GitHub Template

A starter template for building IoT and robotics applications that combine OpenCV‚Äëbased computer vision with LLM‚Äëdriven AI agents orchestrated via the MCP protocol (agent‚Äëto‚Äëagent). Leverage this foundation to rapidly prototype vision‚Äëpowered devices, autonomous robots, and intelligent IoT systems.

Openmcp-robotics is just launching, so be patient or contribute and enjoy!!!

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the template**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/iot-mcp-opencv-template.git
   cd iot-mcp-opencv-template
Launch the Vision MCP Server

bash
Copier
Modifier
cd src/mcp-server
docker build -t mcp-opencv .
docker run --rm -p 50051:50051 mcp-opencv
Run a Vision Example

bash
Copier
Modifier
cd ../../examples/vision-detect
python3 run_agent.py --mcp-host localhost --mcp-port 50051
Integrate Robotics or IoT

Start your ROS/ROS2 bridge in src/ros-mcp

Use src/iot-control scripts to publish MQTT messages or toggle GPIO pins

Combine perception and action in your own workflows

## üõ† Features
OpenCV Vision MCP Server
Expose camera capture, filtering, detection, and tracking via MCP calls.

ROS/ROS2 Bridge
Send high‚Äëlevel navigation or actuator commands to a ROS-based robot.

IoT Device Control
Publish sensor data and receive control commands over MQTT and GPIO.

Example Workflows
Pre‚Äëbuilt demos for detection and navigation to jumpstart your project.

CI / Testing
GitHub Actions pipeline for linting (Flake8) and unit tests (pytest).
